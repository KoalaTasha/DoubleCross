# DoubleCross

Mini game built using the Mojo v3 FPGA and an ALU.

Based on the 3x3 Lights Out puzzle where selecting a square will invert the state of the 4 vertical/adjacent squares and itself (in a shape of a plus). The objective of the original puzzle was to turn all 9 squares into the same colour.

We modified the puzzle into a 5x5 2-player game where each player tries to get a full row and column of tiles in their colours.

# Gameplay

• Double cross is a 2-player game where players try to out-smart (or out-luck) each other

• Players take turns to press a button on the board

• The first player to form a full row and column of tiles in their colour wins

• Each game will last a maximum of 19 turns, after which the player with the most tiles on the board wins

There's an additional game mode too!

• The rules are pretty much the same but the winning condition is a little different 

• The first player to form a solid 3x3 square in their colour wins
